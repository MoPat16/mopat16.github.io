<h1 style= "color: white;"> Programming for Social Science module </h1>

<p style= "color: white;"> The creation of this website was to provide a portfolio of my code for the module's assessment 1. The module provided an introduction in computer programming for social scientists. </p>

<h1 style= "color: white;"> What was required? </h1>

<p style= "color: white;"> For assessment 1 the criteria was to create an Agent Based Model following the instructions provided through the practicals. 
The code that I have provided includes a programme that creates a list of agents which interact with the environment. The agents also interact with each other by sharing information. The model also includes stopping conditions where the agents stop moving within the environment and also stop sharing information. 
Finally, the code also has a GUI and includes the downloading of data from the Internet to initiate further interaction between the agents. </p>

<h1 style= "color: white;"> The Code </h1>

<p style= "color: white;"> The code can either be accessed through my <a style= "color: yellow" href="https://github.com/MoPat16">Github page </a> and selecting the 'Agent Based Model' repository or the code is also available to download from the <a style= "color: yellow" href="https://mopat16.github.io/ASS1model.html">Asessment 1 tab. </a> The process for downloading the code is placed into a word file and can be accessed through the download button below (it is recommended that you download the code through the assessment 1 tab).   </p>
